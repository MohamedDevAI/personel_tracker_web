## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled.
- All exported symbols have JSDoc/TSDoc comments.
- Components are kept small and focused (≤ 200 lines). Large components use sub-components in a `ComponentNameParts/` directory.
- Custom hooks live in `src/hooks/` and encapsulate all side effects.
- Formatting is enforced by Prettier; linting by ESLint + @typescript-eslint.
